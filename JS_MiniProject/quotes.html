        "Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.","Never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.","Stop chasing the money and start chasing the passion.",
        "Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.","Do one thing every day that scares you.","All progress takes place outside the comfort zone.",
        "Don't let the fear of losing be greater than the excitement of winning.", "If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.",
